# RAINFALL-DETECTION
Rainfall prediction combines meteorology and machine learning to forecast the amount of rainfall in a specific area. Accurately predicting rainfall is crucial for optimizing water resource management, enhancing crop yields, and planning water infrastructure effectively.

Rainfall also significantly impacts various aspects of human life, including agriculture and transportation. In addition, it can lead to natural disasters like floods, droughts, and landslides. The objective of this project is to develop a reliable rainfall prediction model, enabling timely preventive actions to mitigate such risks.

APPENDIX:

Linear regression is a fundamental predictive analysis method that leverages past data to forecast an outcome variable. It is widely used in predictive modeling due to its simplicity and ease of interpretation in everyday language.

Linear regression has numerous practical uses across various industries, including economics (e.g., forecasting economic growth), business (e.g., predicting sales figures or employee performance), social sciences (e.g., estimating political preferences based on gender or ethnicity), healthcare (e.g., forecasting blood pressure based on weight, or predicting disease onset using biological factors), and many more.

  The flowchart illustrates the process for building and comparing two machine learning models, a Multiple Linear Regression model and an N-Hidden Layered Network, for weather prediction. Here’s the content extracted from the diagram:

1. **Historical Weather Data**
   - **→ Read the Dataset**

2. **Read the Dataset**
   - **→ Preprocessed Data and select features**

3. **Preprocessed Data and select features**
   - **→ Divide the dataset into two parts for training**

4. **Divide the dataset into two parts for training**
   - Splits into two branches:
     - **Branch 1:** **Multiple Linear Regression Model**
     - **Branch 2:** **N-Hidden Layered Networks**

### Branch 1 (Multiple Linear Regression Model):
   - **→ Train the model**
   - **→ Reduce MSE (Mean Squared Error)**
   - **→ Analysis and Prediction on the test data**
   - **→ Compare and analyze the results**

### Branch 2 (N-Hidden Layered Networks):
   - **→ Train the model**
   - **→ Reduce MSE (Mean Squared Error)**
   - **→ Make predictions on the test data**
   - **→ Compare and analyze the results**

Both branches repeat the training process to minimize the loss and ultimately compare the results after predictions.

Thank You Michael Sir for the guidance.
